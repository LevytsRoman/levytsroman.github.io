        Hi, my name is Roman and I'm a programmer. My first introduction to programming was during a project in one of my applied math courses that used linear regression to reconstruct pictures based on a huge sample. At first, I was skeptical about the results of this relatively simple mathematical operation to reconstruct right side of a picture based on left but was mindblown by the results. Since then I've learned various languages and frameworks and built more to-do lists then I can count. I've also worked as a teacher assistant in a programming bootcamp. It's always gratifying to help and teach people as well as partaking in a rabbit hole with students because everyone asks different questions that would never occur to me.
